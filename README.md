# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to make this project to expand my knowledge on coding. I built this project to help record my learnings during my prework study course. It helped me record my findings and making it accessible all while applying what I learned as I learned it. I learned how to use HTML, Github, JavaScript and CSS to create a website.
