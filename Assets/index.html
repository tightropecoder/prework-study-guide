        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The Box-Shadow property adds shadow effects around and elements frame. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blue and spread radius, and color.</li>
