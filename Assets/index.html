        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The Box-Shadow property adds shadow effects around and elements frame. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blue and spread radius, and color.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
      <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
      <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
      <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
      <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
      <li>The order of code affects the outcome. JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file; we can’t just throw it all in there any which way</li>
      <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
